The `asalookup` script provides a way to obtain the available observations around given objects in the ALMA Science Archive (ASA).

It works by reading a file with either coordinates, or object names, and constructing a query URL that is sent to the ASA.

Keep in mind that abuse of this script might ban your IP from accessing the ASA.
